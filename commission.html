        <p> Almost no game is complete without the main memorable character, who later becomes its hallmark. And regardless of whether the players choose a character for themselves or get a ready-made one, <b>the essence remains the same: characters are a virtual
            personification of the player and must therefore be flawless.</b> Character design rates are a burning issue for anyone who wants to create a special game that will not get lost among hundreds of representatives of the same genre. Of course,
            a character cannot save the game if the plot is poorly thought out, the world is limited to one miserable location, and the game is full of bugs. But characters are the heart of the game − they are the closest element to the player, their
            avatar in the virtual world. Therefore, in no case shouald you try to save money on their creation.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>▸ Interesting fact.</b> The last known study on the most popular game characters goes back to 2011. Guinness polled 13,000 gamers and got this top ten:
        </p>
        <p>1. Mario (Donkey Kong, Nintendo, 1981)</p>
        <p>2. Link (The Legend of Zelda, Nintendo, 1986)</p>
        <p>3. Master Chief (Halo: Combat Evolved, Microsoft, 2001)</p>
        <p>4. Solid Snake (Metal Gear, Konami, 1987)</p>
        <p>5. Cloud Strife (Final Fantasy VII, Square, 1997)</p>
        <p>6. PAC-Man (PAC-Man, Namco, 1980)</p>
        <p>7. Lara Croft (Tomb Raider, Eidos 1996)</p>
        <p>8. Gordon Freeman (Half-Life, Valve, 1998)</p>
        <p>9. Kratos (God of War, Sony, 2005)</p>
        <p>10. Sonic (Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega, 1990)</p>
        <p>▸ Now this is far from representative. But the more optimistic is the prospect of seeing your favorite character in an updated list. We wonder if anyone will do this in the near future?</p>
        <p>▸ Today we are here to dot the i’s and cross the t’s with regards to the character design pricing. Let’s figure out what you need to know before ordering a character creation and how much it will cost you to create two-dimensional and three-dimensional
            characters.
        </p>
        <h4>★ Factors Affecting Character Design Cost</h4>
        <p>With a character, you are actually talking to the player directly. This is not just a well-drawn and implemented 2D or 3D concept, it is individuality with his or her character, appearance, habits, and approach to solving problems. To create a
            character, images of people, animals, plants, fictional creatures, and inanimate objects are used.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>▸ So how much does character design cost?</b> What determines the price and is it possible to somehow influence it? Several main factors directly affect character design cost.</p>

                    <div class="column column--left">
                        <h4>★ Character type</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="contact">
                        <p>This can be either 2D or 3D option. A two-dimensional one is cheaper due to the use of simpler techniques and software and the lack of the need to draw a character from all possible viewing angles.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column column--left">
                        <h4>★ Detailling</h4>

                    </div>
                    <div class="contact">
                        <p>For a 3D character, the number of polygons matters. These are the elements that make up the model: the more of them, the higher the detail. For 2D, the number of shades used and work with shadows are taken into account.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column column--left">
                        <h4>★ Game engine</h4>

                    </div>
                    <div class="contact">
                        <p>Developing characters for different engines can vary significantly in terms of time required. For example, creating a character for Unreal Engine will take much longer and, accordingly, will cost more than for Unity.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column column--left">
                        <h4>★ Team structure</h4>

                    </div>
                    <div class="contact">
                        <p>The complexity of the project becomes a decisive factor in choosing the composition of the team that will work on it. It may turn out that one 2D artist is enough, or maybe even three people will not meet the deadline. Each of
                            them needs to be paid a salary, so the number of people directly affects the final cost of the character.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column column--left">
                        <h4>★ Rigging/skinning</h4>

                    </div>
                    <div class="contact">
                        <p>Creating a character skeleton may be needed both for creating several static poses and for future animation. Usually, this service is not assumed by default and is requested by the client separately. So be prepared for additional
                            costs if you need multiple poses or pre-animation.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column column--left">
                        <h4>★ Work speed</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="contact">
                        <p> How fast do you need results? Is there time to go through several stages of adjustments, alterations, and additions? Usually, the approximate date is indicated by the game art company from which you order the work. If it doesn’t
                            suit you and you need the result faster, it will affect the price. Also, note that not every company will be willing to accelerate. It may have insufficient resources to do so, or it may not want to risk a possible negative
                            impact on quality.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>▸ The best option is to come to the design studio with a clear understanding of what you need. This does not mean that the image of the future character, formed to the smallest detail in all the equipment, should be displayed in your head.
                This means that you understand what role characters will play in the game, their nature and their purpose. You can convey this information to the character design agency and, for example, give them the opportunity to freely interpret the
                character’s image. Then you can adjust the result together with the team.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>Character Creation Progress</h4>
            <p>Character creation is a long and painstaking process, full of the agony of choice, the traps of being secondary, and the eternal search for zest.</p>
            <p>The procedure may vary, but the basic steps here at Kevuru Games are as follows.</p>

            <figure class="wp-block-image">
                <img src="assets/img/allien.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"> </figure>
            <p><b>1. Briefing.</b> To begin with, the description and requirements for the character and the final result are formulated as detailed as possible. Sometimes, for a complete understanding, it is enough to answer standard questions, such as
                game genre,character type, and his or her role in the game. Sometimes this is not enough, and then examples of other characters from games of similar genres are considered.</p>
            <p><b>2. Sketching.</b>Further, the artist prepare sketches of the future character and choose a direction for further work. This stage is also called conceptualization: the concept artist gathers references based on informatiom from the previouse
                stage and create several possible options to choose from. To proceed to the next step, you must select the final version, wich will become the basis for all further to be carried out.</p>
            <p><b>3. Detailing.</b>Chosen sketches are adjusted according to the comments and image requirements. Artist working on the details, poses, clothing options and emotions of the characters. This is where the work ends if it's 2D and no pre-animation
                or multiple poses are required. You can ask for some minor revisions and then approve the project.</p>
            <p><b>4. Modeling.</b>If it's 3D, we perform three-dimensional modeling of the character and all the necessary objects. Modelers create a skeleton configured for animation if necessary in project. The number of rigs depends on the variety of
                actions that the character will perform. This can be idle, walking, running, jumping, squatting, reaching for wepons and manipulating them, and so on.</p>
            <p><b>5. Texturing.</b>After all the necessary 3D modeling stages, the artist move on to Texturing - The process of applying a bitmap image to the surface of a 3D object to give it realism. Some software allows artists to procedually texture
                the model or even draw on the model.</p>
            <p><b>6. Rendering.</b>The character is rendered: the artists adjest textures, materials, lighting, and more. They also work on accessories, clothing, and additinal poses ind 3D.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>▸ At each stage, the company shows you the intermediate results, accepts and implements the necessary revisions, and gets approval to move on to the next step.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>2D Character Design</h4>
            <p>As we've already said, the 2D character Design price will be lower than 3D options.</p>
            <br/>
            <b style="margin-left: 20px;">2D means two-dimensionality, that is, the fact that the image has only two dimensions - length and width.</b>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>Maipulation colors, textures, and shadows can create the illusion of three-dimensionality of such images, but, unlike 3D, they cannot be rotated 360 degrees. To see them from other side, artists need to draw them separately.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>For example, take a look at the 2D characters that the Melkon Art team has been working on.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image">

            <p>You can see more of our 2D characters in our <a href="portfolio.html" style="color: #2f95d1;">Portfolio</a></p>
            <br/>
            <p>2D character can be <strong>raster</strong> or <strong>vector:</strong></p>
            <br/>
            <p>▸ <strong>Vector</strong>images are created using lines. Such drawings are easy to scale, move, change, and manipulate without loss of quantity.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>▸ <strong>Raster</strong>images are created on the basis of pixels, each pixels, each of wich quotes a spacific hue. Raster helps to make the image more realistic and allows for smooth color transitions.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image">
                <img src="assets/img/allien.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"> </figure>
            <br/>
            <p>The salary of a 2D artist character starts at 25$ per hour and depands on skill and experence.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>3D Character Design</h4>
            <br/>
            <b style="margin-left: 20px;">3D character are models with three Dimensions - height, width, and depth.</b>
            <br/>
            <p>The depth gives them volume and they can be rotated 360 degrees and viewed from all angles. Once the key advantages of 3D characters is thir realism and reusablity in other projects. To animate a 3D model, you don't need to redraw it anew
                in every pose - all manipulations are possible because the model had already been worked out from all sides.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Melkon Art team had Developed a huge number of distinctive 3D characters, some examples of which we have included below. You can see more artwork and deails about their creation on the character Design Section.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image">
                <img src="assets/img/allien.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"> </figure>

            <p>Head on to our portfolio to see <a href="portfolio.html">3D characters</a>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>how much does it cost to design a 3D character? The key to the answer is the artit's hourly rate and the time it takes to create a 3D character.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>It takes about twice as long to create a 3D model it does to create someting 2D.</strong>Modeling, Teturing skinning, and rigging of an abstract character takes over 150 hours i total. The more detailed the model, the longer it takes
                to create it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, you can imagine the amount of work.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Let's see how the labor of 2D and 3D character artists in different regions of world is paid.</p>
